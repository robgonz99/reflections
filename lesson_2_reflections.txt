How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
You should only add the appropriate changes to the staging area that you want to commit. 

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
Every new feature could have its own branch.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
It helps me visualize the branches and where they meet so I know when fixes or bugs were introduced.
