When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    If you are on another computer. If you have a friend contributing to the repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    You don't want a pulled change to affect what you are doing on your local machine.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    A fork is a way to "clone" another repository on GitHub under my username.  I would use a fork to copy someone else's repository on GitHub.
    A clone is a copy of a repository either on GitHub or my local computer.  I would use a clone if I want to copy a repository from GitHub to my local computer.
    A branch is a series of commits that is not a part of the master.  I would use a branch if I needed to logically separate a series of commits.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
