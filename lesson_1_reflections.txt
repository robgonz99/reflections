How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
I was able to skip a lot of the text that was the same and only focus on the differences.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
If you mess something up, you can go back to a working file.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having
versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
The computer is not smart enough to logically separate the commits.  It takes a human to properly create the commits.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like 
Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Git is for coding and many times they are interrelated, where Google Docs is typcially for a single doc.  Also, Git is giving
you a total commit where you can go back and view rather than having to track separate files. 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
I would be more willing to try different things because I can always go back to a working version.
